A Gamefic game project

## Installation

    $ bundle install

## Running on the Command Line

    $ rake ruby:run

## Building a CLI Game

    $ rake ruby:build

The script will be saved in the `ruby/build` directory.

## Web-Based Games

The Gamefic SDK also supports web-based versions of games. The project gets built into a single-page application with the Ruby game code compiled into JavaScript.

First you need to install the web project scaffold:

    $ rake web:generate
    $ npm install

## Running a Web Game

To run the app in debug mode:

    $ rake web:run

Open http://localhost:9000 in a browser.

## Building a Web Game

    $ rake web:build

The application will be saved in the `web/build` directory.

## Unit Tests

To run the test suite with Ruby:

    $ rspec

To run the test suite with Opal:

    $ rake opal

The Opal tests can be useful for finding bugs in the web build that do not occur in standard Ruby.
